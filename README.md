# heemod-gui

The R package [heemod](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/index.html) has high-level functions and quite easy to program with for R users. However, learning R can be an impediment in its adoption. 

`heemod-gui` was created with [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) in order to provide a graphical user interface to program State Transition Models such as Markov Models, with a lot of features provided by the powerful `heemod` package. 

With `heemod-gui`, no coding is necessary to build a Decision Model in Health Economic Evaluation.

## Status

Right now, [heemod vignettes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/) from `a` to `f` can be reproduced on `heemod-gui`.

## Demo

You can try heemod on https://icer.io/
